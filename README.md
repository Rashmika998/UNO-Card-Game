# UNO-Card-Game
This a GUI application based on OOP concepts using java built in the netbeans IDE.. This game has 4 player modes which are single player, two player, three player and 4 players.

Game has the basics rules as the real game and consists of several rounds until a player scores more than 500 points.

At the beginning of each round each player is dealt with 7 cards face down. The remaining cards are added to the Draw Pile facedown.

Turn over the top card of the draw pile to begin a Discard Pile.

The players have to find a card from their hands that matches the top card of the Discard Pile either by the number, color, or the action. Then place this card face up on the Discard Pile.

Players even if they have a matching card, can chose whether to play it or not.

If there’s no matching card or player chooses not to play a matching card, he/she has to draw a card from the Draw Pie.

The moment any player has just one card in their hands he/she must shout “UNO” before the next player has taken their turn.

If the first card drawn from the Draw Pile happens to be an Action Card, the Action from that card is carried out by the first player to go.

If it is a Wild card, the first player to start can choose a color to continue the play. If the first card is a Wild Draw Four card, then it has to be put back in to the Draw Pile, shuffle and turn over a new card.
